                free movies, shows, anime, or whatever else. yes, these are "legal" (legal info and disclaimers are at the bottom of the page)
                <br><br><h3>sources</h3>the following are websites where you can watch said questionably legal content.
                
                
                <br><br><h3>legal info for the nerds 🤓</h3>the streaming of pirated material (simply watching it on a website, like all the sources on this page) is in a legal grey-area under us law. the downloading of this content <i>is</i> explicitly illegal, but when it is streamed, only a max of a few minutes of the content is downloaded to the video cache at any given time. as far as i can tell, there have been no formal cases or rulings in the us against those who stream this content, 
                as investigative agencies and copyright holders only really care about taking down the actual sites and servers that host this content, since it would be a total nightmare to investigate and prosecute every user of these sites. the fbi has more important things to do than legally pursuing the millions of people that use these sites every day. 
                i've used them for years without issue. tl;dr, there's no need to worry about the fbi hunting you down, they've got more important things to do.
                <br>as for me (the creator of this site), the sharing of pirated content streams is considered illegal in many juridictions, but is also in a bit of a grey-area, and even huge sites that share sources for this content, such as fmhy.net or /r/piracy have existed for years with very few issues, so there's no need to worry about this site getting taken down.
